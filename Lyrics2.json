"Lyrics":"Tell me I was never good enough Remind me of the demons that I've been running from Tell me who the hell you thought I was Or just blame it on the person, the person I've become Lately, I don't give a fuck 'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone Maybe, I'm already gone I'll never be the same It hit me like a hurricane It hit me like a tidal wave And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say It hit me like a hurricane It hit me like a tidal wave And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me Tell me that I'm lost inside my mind (I reach out but it's pulling me under) Remind me I've been searching for something I won't find Tell me I was never worth the time (I reach out but it's pulling me under) Or just blame it on the person you think I left behind Lately, I don't give a fuck 'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone Maybe, I'm already gone I'll never be the same It hit me like a hurricane It hit me like a tidal wave And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say It hit me like a hurricane (Hurricane) It hit me like a tidal wave (Tidal wave) And I don't know why I drown my mind it got the best of me With your life on the line Ready to die for something When you're at the divide And you're down to nothing Look into my eyes Believe me that the storm is coming Believe me that the storm is coming Down, down, down It's coming down It hit me like a hurricane It hit me like a tidal wave And I don't know why I drown my mind in everything they say It hit me like a hurricane (Hurricane) It hit me like a tidal wave (Tidal wave) And I don't know why I drown my mind, it got the best of me It's coming down, down Believe me that the storm is coming down Lately, I don't give a fuck 'Cause I can't be myself when I'm with anyone And maybe, I'm already gone"}

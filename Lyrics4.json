{"Title":"Dream On",
"Artist":"Aerosmith",
"Lyrics":"Every time that I look in the mirror All these lines on my face getting clearer The past is gone Oh, it went by like dusk to dawn Isn't that the way? Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, oh, oh, oh I know nobody knows Where it comes and where it goes I know it's everybody's sin You got to lose to know how to win Half my life's in books' written pages Storing facts learned from fools and from sages You view the earth Oh, sing with me, this mournful dub Sing with me, sing for a year Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear Sing with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Oh, sing with me, sing for the year Sing for the laughter, and sing for the tear Sing it with me, if it's just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Dream on Dream on I dream on Dream a little, I'll dream on Dream on I dream on I dream on Dream a little, I'll dream on Dream on Dream on Dream on I'll dream on Dream on Dream on I dream on"}
